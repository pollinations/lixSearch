# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We pledge that people participating in the lixSearch community will be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their identity or level of experience.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping others learn and improve

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or other protected characteristics

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Explain the reasoning behind moderation decisions when appropriate

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [support@elixpo.ai](mailto:support@elixpo.ai). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly and promptly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
