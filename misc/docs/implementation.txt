## 1.7 No Drift Handling

Currently:
TTL handles time, but not semantic drift.

Example:
User changes topic mid-session.

Problem:
Session vector store accumulates unrelated embeddings.

Upgrade:

Implement:
Session clustering with online k-means.
If new query centroid distance > θ:
    Spawn new semantic sub-session.

This becomes adaptive memory partitioning.

Major improvement.

## 1.9 No Theoretical Complexity Analysis

Provide:

Time complexity per layer:
- Conversation cache: O(n)
- Vector search (HNSW): O(log n)
- Decomposition cost: O(k)

Provide memory growth function:

M(n_sessions) = Σ_i (E[embeddings_i] × dim × 4 bytes)

Formal scaling model increases systems credibility.
